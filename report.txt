CIS415 project0 report

For mentry.c:

	 * successfully compile.
	 * compiles with no warnings.
	 * works correctly
	 * valgrind reports no memory errors
	 
For mlist.c:

	 * successfully compile.
	 * compiles with no warnings.
	 * successfully links with finddupl.
	 * links with no warnings.
	 * works correctly with S.txt and M.txt
	 * valgrind reports no memory errors

My solution:

I first worked on parsing the txt file(S.txt):

	 * read every three lines and get data 
	 * stored data I need to the struct “Adress” which assigned to mentry->self

Then I filled all the methods in Mentry. After the mecat.c and medort.c work correctly, I moved to mlist.

I first created the hash table inside the mlist. The sturct of the mlist is:



			        -> size(the size of the hash table)
	mlist —>self(Bucket) - |
			       |                   -> data(mentry)
				-> list(N_list)-> |
		 				   -> next(nlist)   *(this part is a linkedlist)

Then I filled all the methods in mlist.

finally, I use valgrind to check memory leak and fixed all the memory leaks. Finished!
